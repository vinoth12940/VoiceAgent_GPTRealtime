# 🚨 Human Agent Escalation System

## Overview

The Voice Agent includes an intelligent escalation system that seamlessly transfers customers to human agents when the AI cannot adequately assist them. This feature ensures customers always receive the help they need, especially in complex or sensitive situations.

## 🎯 Escalation Triggers

The AI agent automatically detects when to escalate based on multiple factors:

### 1. **Direct Customer Request**
Customer explicitly asks to speak with a human:
- "I want to speak to a human"
- "Transfer me to an agent"
- "Can I talk to a real person?"
- "Connect me with someone"

### 2. **Verification Failures**
After **3 failed verification attempts**, the system automatically suggests human agent transfer:
```
Attempt 1: ❌ Verification failed (Attempt 1/3)
Attempt 2: ❌ Verification failed (Attempt 2/3)
Attempt 3: ❌ Verification failed (Attempt 3/3)
         ⚠️ Multiple verification attempts failed. Suggesting transfer to human agent...
```

### 3. **Complex Queries**
Questions outside the AI's knowledge domain:
- Billing disputes
- Policy modifications
- Claims processing
- Legal questions
- Account changes
- Refund requests

### 4. **Customer Frustration Detection**
AI monitors for frustration indicators:
- **Negative phrases**:
  - "This isn't working"
  - "You're not helping"
  - "This is ridiculous"
  - "I'm getting frustrated"
- **Repeated questions** (same question 3+ times)
- **Escalating tone** in language

## 🔄 Escalation Flow

### Step 1: AI Detects Escalation Need
```
Customer: "This is frustrating, I want to speak to someone"
AI: "I understand. Let me connect you with one of our specialist agents..."
```

### Step 2: AI Calls Transfer Tool
The AI invokes `transfer_to_human_agent` tool with:
```json
{
  "reason": "customer_request",  // or "verification_failed", "complex_query", etc.
  "customer_email": "maria92@example.com",
  "summary": "Customer requested human assistance after asking about billing dispute"
}
```

### Step 3: Frontend Shows Transfer UI
```
🔄 Transferring to human agent...
Reason: customer request

✅ Transfer initiated!

📋 Transfer Details:
- Queue Position: Next available
- Estimated Wait: < 2 minutes
- Transfer ID: TRF-20251003-12345

💬 A human agent will be with you shortly. 
   They'll have access to all the information we discussed.
```

### Step 4: Backend Logs Transfer Request
Server console output:
```
================================================================================
🚨 AGENT TRANSFER REQUEST
================================================================================
Transfer ID: TRF-20251003-12345
Reason: customer_request
Customer: Heather Gray (maria92@example.com)
Verified: true
Summary: Customer requested human assistance

Conversation History (5 messages):
  user: I need help with my policy...
  assistant: I'd be happy to help! What's your email address?...
  user: maria92@example.com...
  assistant: Thanks! Let me verify that...
  user: I want to speak to a human agent...
================================================================================
```

### Step 5: Context Passed to Human Agent
Human agent receives:
- **Customer Information**:
  - Name: Heather Gray
  - Email: maria92@example.com
  - Verification Status: ✅ Verified
  - Phone Last 4: 1234

- **Conversation History**: Full transcript of AI conversation
- **Transfer Reason**: Why escalation occurred
- **Summary**: AI's understanding of customer's needs
- **Session Data**: All form fields, policy lookups performed

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Frontend (`app-webrtc.js`)

#### State Tracking
```javascript
// Escalation tracking
let verificationAttempts = 0;
let conversationHistory = [];
let transferInProgress = false;
```

#### Conversation History Capture
```javascript
// Automatically tracks all messages
conversationHistory.push({ 
  role: "user", 
  content: text, 
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString() 
});
```

#### Tool Definition
```javascript
{
  type: "function",
  name: "transfer_to_human_agent",
  description: "Transfer the customer to a human agent...",
  parameters: {
    reason: {
      enum: ["customer_request", "complex_query", "verification_failed", 
             "technical_issue", "customer_frustrated"]
    },
    customer_email: { type: "string" },
    summary: { type: "string" }
  }
}
```

#### Tool Handler
```javascript
if (toolName === "transfer_to_human_agent") {
  transferInProgress = true;
  
  // Prepare complete transfer data
  const transferData = {
    session_id: sessionId,
    reason: args.reason,
    customer_email: args.customer_email || vEmail.value,
    customer_name: vName.value,
    summary: args.summary,
    conversation_history: conversationHistory,
    verified: verified
  };
  
  // Call backend
  await fetch("/api/transfer-to-agent", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { 
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "X-Session-Id": sessionId
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(transferData)
  });
}
```

### Backend (`routes.py`)

#### Endpoint: `/api/transfer-to-agent`
```python
@router.post("/transfer-to-agent")
async def transfer_to_human_agent(
    request: Request,
    x_session_id: str = Header(..., alias="X-Session-Id")
):
    body = await request.json()
    
    # Generate unique transfer ID
    transfer_id = f"TRF-{datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y%m%d')}-{hash(x_session_id) % 100000:05d}"
    
    # Extract all context
    transfer_data = {
        "transfer_id": transfer_id,
        "session_id": body.get("session_id"),
        "reason": body.get("reason"),
        "customer_email": body.get("customer_email"),
        "customer_name": body.get("customer_name"),
        "summary": body.get("summary"),
        "conversation_history": body.get("conversation_history", []),
        "verified": body.get("verified", False)
    }
    
    # Log for audit
    print(f"🚨 AGENT TRANSFER REQUEST: {transfer_id}")
    
    # Return queue information
    return {
        "transfer_initiated": True,
        "transfer_id": transfer_id,
        "queue_position": 2,
        "estimated_wait": "< 2 minutes"
    }
```

System: 🔄 Transferring to human agent...
System: ✅ Transfer initiated! Transfer ID: TRF-20251003-12345
```

### Test Scenario 2: Verification Failure
```
Attempt 1: Wrong email → ❌ Verification failed (Attempt 1/3)
Attempt 2: Wrong name → ❌ Verification failed (Attempt 2/3)
Attempt 3: Wrong last4 → ❌ Verification failed (Attempt 3/3)
System: ⚠️ Multiple verification attempts failed. Suggesting transfer to human agent...

```

### Test Scenario 3: Frustration Detection
```
You: "This isn't working"
You: "You're not helping"

1. **Escalation Rate**: % of conversations that escalate
2. **Escalation Reasons**: Distribution of why escalations occur
3. **Time to Escalation**: Average time before escalation triggered
4. **Post-Escalation CSAT**: Customer satisfaction after human agent resolves
5. **False Escalations**: Cases where AI could have handled
6. **Queue Wait Times**: Actual wait time vs estimated

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
